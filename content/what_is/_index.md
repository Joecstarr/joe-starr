"What is?" is a selection of articles explain an aspect of Math and/or Computer
Science. The idea for "What is?" is taken from the immensely helpful list by
[Professor Nicholas J. Higham](https://nhigham.com/index-of-what-is-articles/).

My collection will deviate slightly from Prof. Higham's list. I'm going try to
explain each concept at three levels (where reasonable):

1) High School - An analogy that should be understandable by a general reader.
2) College - An explanation using up to the language of basic (non-proof based) linear algebra.
3) Research - An explanation geared to "mature" math readers. Note: don't expect precision.
