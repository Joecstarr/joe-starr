# Preparing **undergraduate researchers** for graduate school by **developing their instruction**.

## The course

The course, ISA:4040 _Teaching Your Undergraduate Research_ is based on the
prior work of Hoffmann and Lenoch (Hoffmann & Lenoch, 2013) but reimagined for
undergraduates engaged in undergraduate research. The course's established goal
is to provide experience in instructional design and implementation to
undergraduates whose intention is to continue to graduate school. The course has
been offered for approximately five years by The Iowa Sciences Academy a
division of The University of Iowa, whose mission is to support the success of
undergraduate students interested in research and scientific communication. In
that time the design of the course has primarily been that of a traditional
course, relying on lecture and written/oral assignments taking the form of a
term project. The term project asked students to produce a teaching unit for a
general audience lesson on the student's own research work. This teaching unit
design and execution were graded against a common rubric.

## The Redesign

The redesigned course adopts modern instructional techniques such as
a gradual release of responsibility model (Fisher & Frey, 2013) and ungraded
assessments (Stommel, 2023).

### The Design Goals
The following goals were established to drive the redesign of the course:
1. Students can engage in teaching as a structured activity.
2. Students are confident to **"go rogue"** in their own learning.
3. Students acknowledge that failure breeds success.

### The Plan: Gradual Release

The course began with a model lesson presented by the instructor, based on the
instructor's own research. This was followed by a group discussion where the
design of the model lesson was unpacked giving a practical example for backward
design in the wild. This was supplemented with specific readings from
Understanding by Design (Wiggins & McTighe, 2008). Students were given more
agency as the course moved to discussion of assessment. In this
section of the course, students were given specific sources and
empowered to select their own specific readings. The readings were
discussed in a structured jigsaw activity where students were guided
in sharing their learning from their selected readings. Students were then asked
to prepare and present a five-minute lighting version of their lesson. The final
section of instructional content was a peer review of drafts of their lesson.
Students were asked to structure their own review requests where they prompted
peers for specific feedback relevant to their particular needs. Following the
main instructional portion of the course each student took fifty minutes each to
give their lesson including prompting feedback from their peers. After all
students have completed their lesson, each student conducted a qualitative
analysis of their peer given feedback. This modeled a complete life
cycle for course creation for each student.

### The Plan: Ungrading

The redesigned course has four deliverables for students combined into a
portfolio. First, students were still expected to create the teaching unit.
Second is a collection of the students' design documentation detailing the
evolution of the goals and design of their lesson throughout the
semester. Students are presented with a backward design and
encouraged to utilize it in their design process. As they moved
through the course activities they were invited to change their
minds, **"go rogue"**, and retain the artifacts of their evolving work.
Third, is a collection of reflections on supplemental work. These supplemental
assignments were designed and selected by the student. These included but was not
limited to; literature reviews of teaching research, substantive extensions of
their teaching unit, or self-determined mini-projects impacting their
development in teaching. The final item in the portfolio is a collection of
peer observation prompts and responses written and analyzed by the student.
The redesigned course moves away from a unified rubric and adopts a concept of
ungrading built from the ideas of Jesse Stommel (Stommel, 2023) as well as
discussions with practitioners who have implemented similar methods. The ISA:4040
upgrading strategy fits closely the professional one-to-one and
performance review paradigm. Students were required to attend office hour
one-to-ones with a minimum once a month plus once on the week before they teach,
but were encouraged to attend office hours as frequently as desired.
During these meetings the students' personal course objectives were
discussed, agreed on, and progress evaluated. The semester culminated
with a performance review where the portfolio is reviewed, and a
course retrospective establishes a grade against the agreed on course
objectives.

## The Research

As a portion of a more extensive scholarly review of the
_Teaching Your Undergraduate Research_ course paradigm data was collected on
experience of students in this course. Data was collected from students (n=7)
during interviews which were conducted during final retrospective meetings.

### The Interview

The interview was structured with a standardized question set which addressed
the following areas of interest:

1. General Experience
1. Teaching Unit Development
1. Learning Outcomes
1. Feedback and Revision
1. Impact of Grading Methods
1. Broader Benefits

### Preliminary Report

Data is still being processed as such only preliminary results are presented
here. Student feedback during touchpoints indicates an increase apperception
for the intricacies of instruction as well as increased confidence in students'
self-identification as an instructor. Ungrading, seems to have allowed for
students to decouple the failure of an aspect of their preparation from the
students' failure in the course.

Overall, the gradual release and ungrading models were successful for this
small group of undergraduates. Extending these ideas to other course sections
would provide additional broader data that would help us disaggregate data
across several subgroups of students. We will continue using these instructional
strategies and look for others that will help support our three goals.
