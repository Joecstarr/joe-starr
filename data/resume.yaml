            summary: |-
                In my thesis titled __The Tanglenomicon: Tabulation of Arborescent
                Tangles__, I enumerated a class of knot-theoretic objects called
                arborescent tangles. I identified a unique (up to isotopy)
                representative for each arborescent tangle, the Right Leaning
                Identity Tangle Tree (RLITT). I then created and proved correct
                the abstract algorithms needed for enumeration of RLITT.
                Furthermore, I designed a process architecture that connects
                mathematical research with software design, including formal
                design and validation activities. Within that process I developed
                a modular software architecture in C for general computational
                knot theoretic use cases. Using this architecture, I implemented
                my theoretical algorithms and tabulated arborescent tangles up to
                18 crossings.
