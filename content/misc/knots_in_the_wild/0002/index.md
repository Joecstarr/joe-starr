### Context of the find

A monkey's paw pillow I found at Marshalls.

### Knot Information

This one is hard, it's unclear what is happening in the middle of the pillow. As
it turns out, this is actually not a knot (in the mathematical sense). When you
pull on the string, you find out that the ends are not connected (you can see
this in the background), so this pillow is isotopic to a point.
