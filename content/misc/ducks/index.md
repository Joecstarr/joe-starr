Rubber duck debugging is a playful yet effective method used by programmers to
troubleshoot code. The concept involves explaining your code, line by line, to
an inanimate objectâ€”often a rubber duck. By verbalizing the problem, you can
uncover errors or gain new insights that might not be apparent when simply
reading the code. This technique leverages the cognitive benefits of teaching
and articulation, helping to clarify your thoughts and identify issues. It's a
testament to the power of simplicity in problem-solving, proving that sometimes,
the best solutions come from the most unexpected sources. So, next time you're
stuck on a tricky bug, grab a rubber duck and start talking!
