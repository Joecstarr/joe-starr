"What is?" is a selection of articles which explain an aspect of Math and/or
Computer Science. The idea for "What is?" is taken from the immensely helpful
list by
[Professor Nicholas J. Higham](https://nhigham.com/2020/03/19/what-is-series/)
which was itself inspired by a similar series from the
[AMS](https://arminstraub.com/math/what-is-column).

My collection will deviate slightly from Prof. Higham's list. I will try to
explain each concept at three levels (where reasonable and I have time):

1. General - An acturate but not precise analogy understandable by a general
   reader.
2. Some Training - An acturate but not precise analogy but with precision higer
   then that of the general level.
3. Mature - An acturate and precise (or nearly so) description of the concept.

I'm using this series to build out a process for using generative AI.

This is the worst generative AI will ever be and I think it's important we learn
how it works and how to help our students use it effectively:

-   When a section is AI generated I will include the emoji 🤖 in the section
    header.
-   When a section is AI generated with manual edits I'll include 🤖/👨.
-   When a section is written wholey by myself I'll include 👨.
