<p>A man picks up his daily slice of breakfast pizza from his local gas station. What he doesn&rsquo;t know is that it&rsquo;s his last. By mid-day he feels terrible, by the time he&rsquo;s ready to go home for dinner he&rsquo;s already feasting on brains.</p>

<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated DNA) is the molecule that carries genetic information for the development and functioning of an organism.</p>
<p>DNA is made of two linked strands that wind around each other to resemble a twisted ladder â€” a shape known as a double helix.</p>

Each strand has a backbone. Attached to each sugar is one of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) or thymine (T). The two strands are connected by chemical bonds between the bases: adenine bonds with thymine, and cytosine bonds with guanine.

<p>The spread is now nation wide but still under some control.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve successfully imaged the DNA of the Z-virus and found DNA with a knot. Your CDC coworkers are using your findings to construct an anti-Z-virus. The anti-virus is the mirror of the DNA knot you&rsquo;ve found. This will allow the human body to build anti-bodies for the Z-virus.</p>
<p>The CDC now needs you to verify that the DNA knot they&rsquo;ve produced truly is the mirror of the Z-virus.</p>
